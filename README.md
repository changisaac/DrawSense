# DrawSense
Inspiration
Interfacing with computers have always been limited to the use of pre-built controllers and devices.

What it does
The built system detects differences in capacitance in circuits (using the conductive nature of graphite) thus effectively converting a simple pencil paper drawing to a multi-feedback control interface with the ability to sense different button presses and inputs.
